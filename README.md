# Introduction to Boxplots:
A box plot is used in statistics to display groups of numerical data into their quartiles. There are 3 quartiles, Q1 is defined as the middle number between the smallest number and the median of the data , Q2 is the median (i.e. middle number) and Q3 is the middle value between the median and the highest value of the data set. This will be discussed in more detail in the jupyter notebook file.

# How to Run Jupyter Notebook:
To run the script to invesigate the Numpy.random package and it's functions within Jupyter you must have already downloaded Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) and Python (https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python).

1. Please find the script in the file fundamentals-ofr-data-analysis-project.ipynb within the Fundamentals of Data Analysis project Depository. Copy this code and save to a new file or download it. Name it as you desire.
2. Open Visual Studio Code (VSC). To open the Integrated Terminal, click View and then click the integrated terminal or alternatively use the shortcut cntrl +'.
3. Type jupyter notebook into the Intergrated Terminal and press enter. A new internet tab will be opened.
4. In the Notebook Dashboard navigate to find the notebook: clicking on its name will open it in a new browser tab.
5. You can run the notebook document step-by-step (one cell a time) by clicking on a cell and pressing shift + enter. An sterisk between two square brackets [*] will appear when the code is running. Once the code is run a number will appear between two square brackets eg [1].
6. You can run the whole notebook in a single step by clicking on the menu Cell -> Run All.
7. To restart the kernel (i.e. the computational engine), click on the menu Kernel -> Restart. This can be useful to start over a computation from scratch (e.g. variables are deleted, open files are closed, etc.).



# Conclusion:

Boxplots provide more information regarding the data compared to histograms. Unlike a histogram, you can determine the min, max values, median, upper and lower limit of the data. Outliers are also easier to notice in boxplots. 

In scatter graphs it is difficult to determine the outliers without the best fit line, however you can see the min and max values just by ananlysing the points.

Therefore, boxplots are more useful when trying to distinguish the above factors from presentation alone.
